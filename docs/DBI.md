## Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) at runtime applications.

Common Applications:
+ Runtime profiling 
+ Profile-Guided Optimisations, 
+ Post-link optimisations (such as BOLT) 
+ Applications in security space: Dynamic analysis, deobfuscation, process sheferding

Frameworks:

- [DynamoRIO](https://dynamorio.org/) - Open source dynamic binary instrumentation framework for the development of dynamic program analysis tools. 

- [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) - Open source. Implements more heavy-weight instrumentation, compared to DyanmoRIO. But looks similar.

- [Pin](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html) - Closed Source, Targets only Intel Platforms. Uses just-in-time compilation to perform arbitrary instrumentation tasks at user-selected points. 

- [QBDI](https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI) Quick Binary Deobfuscation and Instrumentation, Dynamic Binary Instrumentation framework based on LLVM. - Mainly used for dynamic analysis and deobfuscation, performance optimisation is not its primary domain.

- [CaPI](https://github.com/tudasc/CaPI) - Does something with LLVM XRay runtime-adaptable instrumentation and user-defined regions.

- [Instrew](https://github.com/aengelke/instrew) - LLVM-based Dynamic Binary Instrumentation

- [DynInst](https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst) - API for runtime code patching

- [VMAD](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-28652-0_12) - dynamic program analysis and instrumentation framework.
